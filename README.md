# Network services
I upload these practices to GitHub, because whilst doing them I found **_REALLY_** difficult to find some proper documentation or any good tutorial. And yes I'm looking at you GNUgk
## Machines used in these practices
These practices were made with the following virtual machines in VMWare:
- Xubuntu 18.04 LTS (Labeled Xubuntu Server)
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (One making function of client and the another makes the NAT Services)
- Windows Server 2008 R2 (One makes NAT and the another is the domain controller and where most of the practices are made)
- Windows 7
- Windows 10
